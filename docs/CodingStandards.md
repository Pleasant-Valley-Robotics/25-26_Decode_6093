# Commenting on Files

- A block at the top of each file describing what the purpose of the file is to do, i.e. This is an auto that is intended to park, and score 3 elements in the following 
order using xyz subsystems.

- A block at the top of each function that denotes the function name, description, parameters, and return variables.

- Add in-line comments to any line of code that is performing more than a simple get/set describing what the line performs. 

- When referencing external numbers, i.e. motor inputs, please add a hyperlink to the associated material, whether it's made internally within the team, or externally 
within the vendor.

# Naming Convention

- CamelCase - i.e. EveryWordOfAVariableGetsCapitalized
- Be specific, provide necessary information for variables
- Be concise, use no words beyond what's necessary

# Magic Numbers

- No magic numbers, always set up a variable when using a number that could be used in more than one place.
