 * This robot starts up against the goal and launches all three projectiles before driving away

 * at any time. As it moves through the autonomous period and completes different functions,
 * it will move forward in the enum. This allows us to run the autonomous period inside of our
 * main robot "loop," continuously checking for conditions that allow us to move to the next step.

     * We use "state machines" in a few different ways in this auto. The first step of a state
     * machine is creating an enum that captures the different "states" that our code can be in.
     * The core advantage of a state machine is that it allows us to continue to loop through code,
     * and only run the bits of code we need to at different times. This state machine is called the
     * "LaunchState." It reflects the current condition of the shooter motor when we request a shot.
     * It starts at IDLE. When a shot is requested from the user, it'll move into PREPARE then LAUNCH.
     * We can use higher level code to cycle through these states, but this allows us to write
     * functions and autonomous routines in a way that avoids loops within loops, and "waits."
